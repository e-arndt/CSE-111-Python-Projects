CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Artwork Search

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
Provide visitors to an art gallery a way to search for artwork by artist or keyword.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
How to connect python programs to a SQL database, search for (query), retrieve and display data from a DB.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
At least two: mysql.connector and os
(Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need?
clrscr()  
main()  
mysql_query()

(Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result. Functions that get user input and print results are important and do useful work but are not easily reusable.)
(Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions to have parameters and return a result.)

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
test_mysql_query
